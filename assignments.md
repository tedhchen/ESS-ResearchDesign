## Weekly Discussion Leader
In each of seven specifically designated weeks (marked in the outline), we will have 1-2 students act as discussion leaders. As the discussion leader, you have the following tasks.
- choose a reading that features the design issue of the week
- prepare a set of discussion questions based on the week's design issue and readings
- send the reading and discussion questions (draft is fine) to the rest of the class by the end of Friday of the previous week
- give a 10-15 minute presentation on some aspect of the design issue of the week; this should be an extension or a "tangent" rather than a summary of the assigned readings, but can include a discussion of the readings
- facilitate discussion during class
- if there are two discussion leaders, they should coordinate to avoid overlapping content

## "What is theory and what is it good for?" Short Writing Assignment
Drawing on the readings and discussions from weeks 1-2, discuss  what you think "theory" is, and why might theory/theories be good (or bad) for the scientific endeavor. Your discussion should engage with (and cite) the assigned readings and beyond, but it should not be a simple summary of what others have said. It is a think piece with your arguments grounded in existing work.
- the discussion should be about 1000 words
- due on Feb 1
