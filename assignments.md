## Weekly Discussion Leader
In each of seven specifically designated weeks (marked in the outline), we will have 1-2 students act as discussion leaders. As the discussion leader, you have the following tasks.
- choose a reading that features the design issue of the week
- send the reading to the rest of the class by noon on Thursday the previous week
- prepare a set of discussion questions based on the week's design issue and readings
- give a 10-15 minute presentation on some aspect of the design issue of the week (ideally, this is on a "tangent" rather than a summary of the assigned readings)
- facilitate discussion during class
- if there are two discussion leaders, they should coordinate to avoid overlapping content
