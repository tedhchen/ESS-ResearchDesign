## Weekly Discussion Leader
In each of seven specifically designated weeks (marked in the outline), we will have 1-2 students act as discussion leaders. As the discussion leader, you have the following tasks.
- choose a reading that features the design issue of the week
- prepare a set of discussion questions based on the week's design issue and readings
- send the reading and discussion questions (draft is fine) to the rest of the class by the end of Thursday of the previous week
- give a 10-15 minute presentation on some aspect of the design issue of the week; ideally, this is on an extension or a "tangent" rather than a summary of the assigned readings, but can definitely include a discussion of the readings
- facilitate discussion during class
- if there are two discussion leaders, they should coordinate to avoid overlapping content

## Research Design Project
The major assignment in this course is to produce a publication-level and implementable research design.

### Logistics
The research design project should be completed in teams ranging from 1-3 students. Team members will receive the same grade for the project unless there are extenuating circumstances. At any point up until the third checkpoint is submitted, teams can merge until the max of 3 is met.

### Timeline
#### First checkpoint (Week 4)
- present the theory and the derived research question
- propose a measure and discuss its strengths and weaknesses
- approximately 1-2 pages
- meet Ted by Sep 15 to discuss project ideas
- ready for discussion on Sep 18
- written version due on Sep 22

#### Second checkpoint (Weeks 6 and 7)
- refinement of previous draft (or completely new topic)
- discuss the target population and sampling considerations
- approximately 3-4 pages
- ready for discussion on Oct 2
- written version due on Oct 13

#### Third checkpoint (Week 10)
- refinement of previous draft (or completely new topic)
- discuss all aspects of internal validity in the study (e.g. threats and assumptions required)
- approximately 5-6 pages
- ready for discussion Oct 30
- written version due Nov 3

#### Presentation
- 15 minute presentation on Nov 27 (and maybe Nov 20 depending on the number of teams)
- written draft due Nov 17 (for peer feedback purposes)

#### Peer Feedback
- 5 minute peer review presentation on Nov 27 (and maybe Nov 20 depending on the number of teams)
- written version (1-2 pages) due Nov 28

#### Written design
