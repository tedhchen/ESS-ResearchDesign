## Description
This course is focused on the logic of making inferences about the relationship between 

### Target Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students will:
- be familiar with current research standards in environmental social science
- be familiar with fundamental research design considerations in the social sciences
- have produced a research design that can be developed into a paper
- have practiced critically assessing research designs proposed by their peers

## Course Expectations

### Classroom Organization
This course is held online synchronously. Generally speaking, the instructor or that week's designated student discussion leaders will begin each session with a short overview of the week's topic and set the stage for discussion with some questions. The remainder of each session will be for open discussion, which can be about anything relevant to the week's topic, including how the design questions raised during the week are relevant to student research design projects. In some specifically designated weeks, we will spend a larger portion of our time on the research design projects. 

Outside of our synchronous meeting time, we will use a Slack workspace to organize additional engagement with the material and to work on the research design projects. Each project will have its own channel, which make it easier for the instructor to keep track of progress and help out where appropriate.

### Students can expect from the instructor
- I am trained in political science, and I have additional specializations in environmental social science and network science. How I approach research is naturally influenced by my background, but I will strive to present a wide variety of materials that are in line with current standards in environmental social science research.
- I will respect studentsâ€™ backgrounds and strive to make the course an inclusive learning environment by following the course [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link conduct.md %}).
- I am willing to continue to help students with their research after the course if it makes sense. This can be in a variety of capacities ranging from providing feedback to formal collaboration.

### I expect from students
- Commitment to research and hands-on learning. This is a discussion and research-based course, where lectures are designed as supporting material.
- Respect for everyone involved with the course (i.e. students, instructor, guest lecturers), and follow the course [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link conduct.md %}). It is especially important to understand that the class will comprise individuals from diverse and multidisciplinary backgrounds. Communication and patience are paramount.
- Basics: do the readings; come to class; contribute to team work.
