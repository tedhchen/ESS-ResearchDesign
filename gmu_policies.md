### Late Policy
I will deduct one letter grade from a written assignment for each week it is past due. I will give no credit for the in class discussion leader assignment. 

### Communication
Students must use their Mason email account to receive important University information, including communications related to this class. I will not respond to messages sent from or send messages to a non-Mason email address on matters relating to this class.

### Campus Closure or Emergency Class Cancelation/Adjustment Policy
If a class meeting needs to be canceled or adjusted due to weather or other concern, students should check their emails for updates on how to continue learning and for information about any changes to events or assignments.

### Disability Accomodations
Disability Services at George Mason University is committed to upholding the letter and spirit of the laws that ensure equal treatment of people with disabilities. Under the administration of University Life, Disability Services implements and coordinates reasonable accommodations and disability-related services that afford equal access to university programs and activities. Students can begin the registration process with Disability Services at any time during their enrollment at George Mason University. If you are seeking accommodations, please visit http://ds.gmu.edu/ for detailed information about the Disability Services registration process. Disability Services is located in Student Union Building I (SUB I), Suite 2500. Email:ods@gmu.edu; Phone: (703) 993-2474

### Names and Pronouns
If you wish, please share your name and gender pronouns with me and indicate how best to address you in class and via email or using the zoom function. I use he/him pronouns for myself and I prefer that you address me as "Ted" in all contexts.

### Academic Integrity
The integrity of the University community is affected by the individual choices made by each of us. Mason has an Honor Code with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three fundamental and rather simple principles to follow at all times are that: (1) all work submitted be your own; (2) when using the work or ideas of others, including fellow students, give full credit through accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for clarification. No grade is important enough to justify academic misconduct. Plagiarism means using the exact words, opinions, or factual information from another person without giving the person credit. Writers give credit through accepted documentation styles, such as parenthetical citation, footnotes, or endnotes. Paraphrased material must also be cited, using the appropriate format for this class. A simple listing of books or articles is not sufficient. Plagiarism is the equivalent of intellectual robbery and cannot be tolerated in the academic setting. If you have any doubts about what constitutes plagiarism, please see me.

### COVID-19 Policy
To support your safety and the safety of everyone in this class, all students are required to complete the [Mason COVID Health Check](https://www.gmu.edu/mason-covid-health-check){:target="_blank"} before a physical office hour. I will ask you to show that you have received a "green" notification to participate in a physical office hour. If you suspect that you are sick, please stay home and contact me about options for virtual office hours.

### Notice of mandatory reporting of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking
As a faculty member, I am designated as a "Non-Confidential Employee," and must report all disclosures of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking to Mason's Title IX Coordinator per University Policy 1202. If you wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact one of Mason's confidential resources, such as Student Support and Advocacy Center (SSAC) at 703-993-3686 or Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 703-993-2380. You may also seek assistance or support measures from Mason's Title IX Coordinator by calling 703-993-8730, or emailing titleix@gmu.edu.
